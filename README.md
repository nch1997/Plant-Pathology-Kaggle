## Plant-Pathology-Kaggle (Categorical Classification with Deep Learning)
Categorize leaf diseases

Details of the project and files can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7. This repository contains my code and answers to the Kaggle Project.<br/> <br/> **resnet50_oneshot** - finalized model which unfreezes RESNET and fine tuning intsantly <br/> <br/> **resnet50_train** - Shows how to free and unfreeze transfer learning model manually <br/> <br/> **train_model_ori** - base model model with self made architecture
